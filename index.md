Hey, my name is *Vasilii Nikonov* and I am a student at **UCSD Revelle College**.

# Brief List of Hobbies
* Hiking
* Coding
* Watching Netflix with my friends

## List of Mountains climbed
1. White Mountain 14,252ft Mono County, CA
2. Mount San Antonio 10,064ft Los Angeles County, CA
3. North Fortuna 1,293ft San Diego, CA

I dream of Climbing Mount Whitney, but it requires a permit, that is hard to get, and a lot hiking experience. You can read about Mount Whitney here: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney)

I also love coding. I have extensive experience with JavaScript. It is a fun language, because of implicit type coersions. You can have something like `[[]] == 0`. It does blow the mind of a lot of people, when they start learning Java Script. I want to have more fundamental knowledge, so I thats why I did sign up for CSE12 and CSE15L.

```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
Working with Java would be fun. *public stativ void main string args* I repeat that to myself every time before going to sleep. AHAHAH - It does sound like something from Harry Potter.
