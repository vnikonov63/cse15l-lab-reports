## Installing Visual Studio Code
Its is not diffuclut, trust me, just follow [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on official Visual Studio Code website. Make sure to choose the correct operation system. When you open it up, you should see something like this:

<br></br>
From the very begining I recommend to use the dark theme. Much easier on your eyes.

## Remotely Connecting
Open the terminal in VSCode, or any other terminal you prefer. Then write the following code:

```
ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng.ucsd.edu
```
Then enter your password, and after that you will acess the remote server. You will use *Secure Remote Login and File Transfer* to control remote machine from your local.

**Make sure to write `cs15` instead of `cse15`**

You should see something like this:

What you see will be different from what your peers see, because everybody connects at a different time. Within the cluster Users correcond to the # of people connected to a specific computer. For example I am the only one connected to 202. Load and Averages how extensively people use the cluster system.
